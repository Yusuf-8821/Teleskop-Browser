## 📖 Overview

**Teleskop** is a next‑generation web browser designed from the ground up to deliver the **ultimate in privacy, performance, and user control**. It pairs with its own independent search engine, **Keşif Dürbünü** (“Discovery Binoculars”), to offer a completely integrated, surveillance‑free browsing experience.

Every aspect of Teleskop has been built to answer the question: *“What if a browser did everything right?”* – from a stunning, modern interface to an uncompromising security model that never harvests your data.
